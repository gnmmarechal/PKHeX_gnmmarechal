A custom PKHeX build with extra functions I (gnmmarechal) personally wanted.

Notes: The original PKHeX creator uses MM/DD/YYYY to number his updates, 
while I use DD/MM/YYYY.

06/09/2015: Initial Custom Build
********************************

Based on PKHeX 06/09/2015 (MMDDYYYY)
Added Button to automatically set perfect IVs (cuz it bores me to hit CTRL :D)
Click on HP/DEF/ATK/etc to max IVs.
Click on "Finish up" to reroll encryption constant and PID.
Save/Load OT Information (except gender, please set it manually)
Added a link to Bulbapedia (So you can check legality :D)
Added a "Egg Met" button.
Added a Location Fixer (WIP)
Added a Today button to the date picker.
NOTE: Many of these features are already available on the default PkHex. 
However, I personally prefer having a button to do them for me.
